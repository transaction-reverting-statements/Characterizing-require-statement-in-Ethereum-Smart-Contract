# Characterizing-require-statement-in-Ethereum-Smart-Contract
Dataset for the manuscript "Characterizing Transaction-Reverting Statements in Ethereum Smart Contracts", including the contract dataset of tmeplate contract and dapp contracts, as well as the results of use purpose classification and customization patterns classification on transaction-Reverting statements.
- <span style='background:#e6e6e6;'>dataset</span> folder includes the template contract dataset and dapp contract dataset we constructed.
- <span style='background:#e6e6e6;'>user_purpose_taxonomy</span> folder includes the use purpose taxonomy classification results for both dapp contracts and template contracts.
- <span style='background:#e6e6e6;'>customization_pattern_use_purpose_taxonomy</span> folder includes the use purpose taxonomy  classification results for 100 random selected customization patterns.
- <span style='background:#e6e6e6;'>running_cases</span> folder includes the running result of the increased case and decreased case shown in RQ4, which is detected by the Oyente tool.
- Here is the description for the [analyzer](https://github.com/echohermion/solidity-parser-python) used in RQ3 for identifying customization patterns of transaction-reverting statements.
